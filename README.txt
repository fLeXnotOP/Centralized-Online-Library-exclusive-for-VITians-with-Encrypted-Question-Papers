There are multiple "templates" "templates-Copy" Folders in the project, but the one that
has been used is the one with the address location \loginbackend\templates - Copy
all others are of no use. 
NOTE:-
(This suggestion may/ maynot be applicable to you as this was created long-ago, and I don't remeber
it now, but just keep in mind that \loginbackend\templates - Copy is the only file that's
used to store all the templates) 



To runserver:- python manage.py runserver
